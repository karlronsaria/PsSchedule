### wish
I wish
- [ ] I wish I could access an action item's file by selecting from a numbered list
  - karlr: Why not just use 'sls' or 'grep'?
- [ ] I could see expired action items from earlier today
- [ ] I could see high-priority deadlines within a week or month's notice but low-priority deadlines within a day's notice
- [x] I could parse text rendered by the ``Write-*`` cmdlets but still see different-colored text
- [x] I could see today's work schedule
