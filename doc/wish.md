# I wish

- [ ] 2025_02_15_163440
  - I considered changing the name of this module to "PsScheduleGun" and adding a gun sound effect when "Get-MySchedule" is fired.

- [ ] ``when`` objects had a robust structure
  - example

  ```text
  - type: event, recur
  - when
    - date
      - from
      - to
    - time
      - from
      - to
  ```

  ```text
  - type: event
  - when
    - 1
      - date
        - from
        - to
    - 2
      - date
        - from
        - to
  ```

  ```text
  - type: event
  - when
    - time
      - from
      - to
    - 1
      - date
        - from
        - to
    - 2
      - date
        - from
        - to
  ```

  ```text
  - type: event
  - when
    - time
      - from
      - to
    - date
      - 1
        - from
        - to
      - 2
        - from
        - to
  ```

- [ ] ``Get-MarkdownTable`` could extricate style information, such as *italic* _text_ or **bold** __text__

- [ ] the node delimiter ``:`` would have an escape sequence

- [ ] ``Get-MarkdownTable``
  
  - actual
    
    ```powershell
    > (cat example.md | Get-MarkdownTable).list.list_subitem
    
    when       what
    ----       ----
    2023_01_05 sus
    2023_01_06 ihr
    2023_01_07 oth
    ```
  
  - expected
    
    ```powershell
    > cat example.md | Get-MarkdownTable
    
    when       what
    ----       ----
    2023_01_05 sus
    2023_01_06 ihr
    2023_01_07 oth
    ```

- [ ] I could identify expired action items
  
  - and have the option
    - to remove them
    - or to move them to an archive or ignored folder

- [ ] I could see expired action items from earlier today

- [ ] I could see high-priority deadlines within a week or month's notice but low-priority deadlines within a day's notice

- [ ] 2022_11_09_175458
  
  - I could write action items in list form under a single ``sched`` heading, using the ``what`` field as the title
    
    - example
      
      - typical form
        
        ```
        # sched
        - what: read
        - when: mon-1800
        - every: week
        - type: routine
        
        # sched
        - what: write
        - when: tue-1800
        - every: week
        - type: routine
        ```
      
      - new form
        
        ```
        # sched
        - read
          - when: mon-1800
          - every: week
          - type: routine
        - write
          - when: tue-1800
          - every: week
          - type: routine
        ```

  - solution
    - 2023_02_02_130327
      - remove values from ``res/setting.json#RotateOnProperties``
      - continue to use module until something doesn't look right

- [x] action trees had a low-emphasis branch (e.g. ``log``) that could be muted for ``Find-MyTree``

- [x] ``Get-MySchedule`` had ``-Week``

- [x] recurring schedule items had ``startDate`` (and possibly ``endDate``)

- [x] ``MySchedule`` functions had ``-WhatIf`` flag
  - cancelled
    - needless, since neither function in ``MySchedule`` makes any file system changes

- [x] ``MySchedule`` functions had parameter inference
  - [x] ``Get-MySchedule``
  - [x] ``Find-MyTree``

- [x] an action item could tell me in schedule view whether or not it has an unfinished todo-list

- [x] I could identify and interact with the checkboxes that appear in markdown action items

- [x] I could schedule an action item for the same time every monday, friday, and saturday
  
  - solution
    
    - refactor: ``every' = every union 2^(Mon + Tue + Wed + ... + Sun)``
      
      ```
      example
          every: Mon, Tue, Wed, Fri
      thus
          every = (Mon: (0|1), Tue: (0|1), ... Sun: (0|1))
          every = (2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)
          every = 2^7
          every = 2^(Mon + Tue + Wed + ... + Sun)
      ```
    
    - example
      
      ```
      # sched
      - what: college development course
      - when: 1000
      - every: Mon, Wed, Fri
      - type: routine
      ```
      
      - above is equivalent to
      
      ```
      # sched
      - what: college development course
      - when: mon-1000
      - every: week
      - type: routine
      
      # sched
      - what: college development course
      - when: wed-1000
      - every: week
      - type: routine
      
      # sched
      - what: college development course
      - when: fri-1000
      - every: week
      - type: routine
      ```

- [x] I wish I could access an action item's file by selecting from a numbered list
  
  - karlr: Why not just use 'sls' or 'grep'?
  - solution: C:\shortcut\bin\schedsearch.bat

- [x] I could parse text rendered by the ``Write-*`` cmdlets but still see different-colored text

- [x] I could see today's work schedule
